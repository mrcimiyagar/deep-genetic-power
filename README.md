# deep-genetic-power
### a new AI model made by mixing deep learning and genetic algorithm and SVM ( and some other postprocessing and transfer learning technologies ) . there are multiple approaches and proposed models presented and tested in the repository as an experience of developing deep learning models as my second AI model and my first prediction and forecast AI development .
### used python libraries :
##### Deap ( genetic algorithm )
##### tensorflow and keras ( deep learning )
##### Scikit-Learn ( for preprocessing and postprocessing data )
